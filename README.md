## Overview
The goal of this project was to utilize machine learning models to analyze credit card risks. Oversampling, undersampling, and a combination of the two were done to identify the best way to properly train the model. After this, Balanced Random Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemble Classifier were both used to evaluate the performance of the created models. The goal was to identify a reliable way to minimize the threat of credit card risk for potential consumers.
